                    <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
                    <p>I am currently working with professor Ken Van Tilburg in constraining the parameter space of <int>dark photons in the solar basin</int>. Specifically, we are using new experimental data in order to constrain the coupling constant of dark photons that are stuck in bound orbits around the sun. To do so, we take into account planetary dynamics to create an estimate of the density of dark photons in the solar basin.</int></p>
                    <p>Additionally, I am studying <int>Gauge Theories</int> under professor Hisham Sati in order to apply it to studying the symmetries and conservation laws of <int>theories beyond the standard model</int>. In particular after a <int>directed study</int> over the summer, we currently started working on a project algebrically describing Chern-Simmons gravity.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I am finishing my <int>Thesis</int> project under professor Francesco Arneodo and Dr. Laura Manenti in predicting the <int>acoustic signals of minimum ionising particles in noble fluids</int>. We derived and currently study the damped wave equation that describes the acoustic signature of such particles. This provided exposure on partial differnetial equation solving techniques, the study of conservation laws, propagators, etc. as well as gave the opportunity to learn to develop numerical simulations from scratch to solve BIVPs. After determining the energy deposition mechanism of minimum ionising particles, I am studying under Dean Marta Losada (NYUAD) the energy deposition of CP-braking wimps in noble liquids.</p>
                    <p>Also, I am working as part of the <int>XENONnT Collaboration</int> in <int>computationally simulating the waveforms</int> produced by particles in the XENONnT detector. Specifically, my task is to troubleshoot and develop a Monte-Carlo Method to generate random data for the simulator reliably. Through this project I was exposed to more advanced statistical analysis and probaility as well as computationl modelling.</p>
                    <p>Other interesting projects include a 3D numerical treatment of the <int>Stern Gerlach Experiment</int>, and the development of an <int>optimization algorithm</int> based on an ant colony's task allocation method.</p>
                    <h3>COURSES</h3>
                    <p>Differential Geometry, Quantum Field Theory (Graduate Course), General Relativity, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Partial Differnetial Equations, Advanced Quantum Mechanics, Abstract Algebra, Numerical Analysis, Computational Physics, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differnetial Equations, Multivariable Calculus, Mechanics, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Special Relativity, Probability and Statistics</p>

                    <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
                    <p>Currently I am working under Professor Francesco Arneodo and Dr. Laura Manenti in the Astroparticle Laboratory in NYUAD. Here I was involved in multiple projects, the lastest being the design, development, and analysis of a compact dark matter <int>Dielectric Haloscope</int>. This project utilizes laternating dielectric fields to collapse the superposition of dark-photons so that through kinetic mixing would produce standard model photons. I designed and optimized the lens and dielectric stack, as well as created from scratch particle physics simulations of the signal using GEANT4. I further assisted in the CAD design, assemply, testing, data collection, and error estimation.</p>
                    <p>Also, in the Astroparticle Laboratory I was involved with simulating the function and designing elements of a <int>compact X-Ray fluorometer</int> with cultural heritage analysis applications. The goal was to quantitativley determine the surface elemental composition of ancient artefacts. There I designed a hardware PID for helium distribution for cooling, as well as helped in the backend analysis code of the instrunment, maintenance, and CAD design.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I have worked under the Guidance of Dr. Dimitra Atri in analysing the <int>impact of solar storms on the ionic composition of the martian atmosphere</int>. This project was done in collaboration with the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) in the UAE. We continued the development of a particle physics simulation in GEANT4 in order to extract the ionization rates.</p>

                    <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
                    <p>My latest project is the development of an <int>optimization algortihm</int> based on an <int>ant colony's task allocation behavior</int>. Specifically, after studying the method by which ants perform recruiting on areas in need of a particular specialty we have devised a stimergy based optimization algorithm that solves the minimum covering problem. Through this project I learned how to start, develop, test, and complete a research project from scratch as it ended up being my first academic paper. I also learned how to use hardware accelleration on certain numerical schemes, and delve deeper on mathematical modelling.</p>
                    <p>I have also designed a <int>material classification system</int> that utilizes <int>machine learning</int> and the frequency of artefacts from a cheap ultrasoninc distance sensor. Specifically, pointing the sensor at different textures would yield a different pattern of false distance readings. I developed a simple <int>Artifical Neural Network</int> to classify the artefacts in order to get a continous quantitative estimate of the soughness of a material's surface.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I have worked under professor Mohammed Eid, in the Applied Multimedia Laboratory in NYUAD. Where I did research in <int>haptic interfaces</int>. There I was tasked to develop a system for the rapid <int>temperature control</int> of thermoelectic units to be used in thermovibrotactile funneling interfaces. I was also in charge of performing an <int>applied physics analysis</int> on the properties of material candidates to be used for <int>soft haptics</int> applications. Finally, I was part of creating a guidance system for visually impaired people that uses vibrational feedback to communicate the structure of their surroundings.</p>
